//Example for Interface.
//Dont create class. Create New->Interface
//We cannot create objects for interface since it doesnt allow any implementation
//since it is abstract by default.
//Interface is also a class,but not a class,we cant define on our own in interface.
//Interface cannot have implemented methods.
//INTERFACE(100% abstraction).
